# Handicap-Index-Tracker
Creating a program where I can enter my golf score as well as some course data required to calculate a golf handicap. It will keep track of all prior scores to update my handicap index accordingly.

I know there are plenty of these out there but I am a beginner programmer and wanted a interesting project to work on. I will be uploading the new file as I continue to code it more. 

After Day 1 I am stuck with being able to append each new differential(score) as a separate item in the existing list. Instead they all get appended into the same string. I will continue working on a fix to get this up and running.
